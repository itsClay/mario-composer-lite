# Mario Composer Lite

A fan project from a favorite game that I grew up playing as a child. Users can select a specific mario-related sounds and place them on a sheet of music to compose a song.

## Wireframes
The app will be a single page sound board with a moving line so users can see the timing of their sounds. There will be a tool bar at the top consisting of different sound icons. The music sheet will be a 16 x 6 grid where users may click to place the highlighted icon on the grid. the positions of the icons will not reflect different sound pitches. Finally the lower toolbar will control the play of the sounds.

## Technologies used
1. Vanilla Javascript and jQuery for structure and handling specific events.
2. Howler.js to handle concurrent sounds and caching.
3. Webpack to bundle and serve scripts.


#### Future Features:
1. Add multiple pitches of every sound.
2. Drag and drop icon functionality.
3. Extendable loops for longer songs.
4. Export/import functionality.
